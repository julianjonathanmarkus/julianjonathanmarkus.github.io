Hello!
Welcome to my personal website. My name is JJ, it's nice to e-meet you!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Organizational Design and Behavior at WU Vienna University of Economics and Business. My research focuses on the intersection of organizational design, ways of working, and employee behavior. I am especially interested in how people can prosper at work and how organizations can align human flourishing with organizational success.

The central question that motivates my research is how we can improve organizations for the sake of employees and, consequently, drive organizational success. One stream of my research examines organizational decentralization, exploring how authority is redistributed, how decisions are made outside traditional hierarchies, and how individuals experience autonomy and responsibility. A second stream focuses on the implications of organizational design choices, such as levels of hierarchy, and how these choices affect both human and organizational outcomes.

I am passionate about ensuring that research generates not only academic contributions but also practical impact. As co-founder of[People & self-managing organizations-PASMO](https://www.rsm.nl/faculty-research/pasmo/) and a team member of [Headquarters in Austria-HiA](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/hia-home/hia-project), I work closely with organizations and practitioners to co-create knowledge and develop insights that support new ways of working. I also teach courses on organizational design and consultancy at the bachelor’s and master’s levels, equipping future leaders with the tools to design more effective and humane workplaces.

Previously, I was a visiting researcher at the Rotterdam School of Management and INSEAD, and I worked as a research assistant at the Rotterdam School of Management, where I also earned my Master of Science in Human Resource Management, graduating with distinction and receiving the HRM Thesis of the Year Award in 2022. Prior to my academic career, I completed the International Management double degree at Avans University of Applied Sciences and NEOMA Business School in Reims. From 2011 to 2020, I worked in industry in roles ranging from frontline employee to middle manager and HR specialist, gaining international experience in the Netherlands, Malta, Bulgaria, France, and Belgium.
