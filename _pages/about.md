Hello!

Welcome to my personal page. My name is JJ.

I have been working as a Ph.D. candidate at the WU Vienna University of Economics and Business (IIB) since September 2022.

My research focuses on the intersection between ways of working, organization designs, and behavior. This focus stems from interests in questions revolving around people prospering at work and its relationships to organizational success. In my work, I aim for the highest standards in publishing while developing research with substantial practical impact. Currently, I am focusing on people management within decentralized organizations.

Besides conducting research, I have roles in two collective research initiatives: People and Self-Managing Organization (PASMO), co-founder. PASMO is a collective research project, organized through the Rotterdam School of Management, focusing on self-managing organizations (SMO) and the life of people working for SMOs. Headquarters in Austria (HiA), team-member. HiA is an “umbrella project” for various projects and activities, all of which have the goal of supporting companies in designing their organizations and especially their headquarters, as well as contributing to Austria remaining an attractive location for headquarters. Furthermore, I teach courses on organizational design and consultancy at both bachelor and master's levels.

Take a look at the projects here:

Before my Ph.D., I studied International Management and International Business at Avans UAS in Breda and NEOMA Business School in Reims through the IPBS International Double Degree. These studies were complemented by international internships and work experience in the Netherlands, Malta, Bulgaria, France, and Belgium. In 2022, I finished a two-year Master of Science program in Human Resource Management at the Rotterdam School of Management, where I graduated with distinction and was awarded the HRM thesis of the year award.

Through various student jobs and internships, I have accumulated ten years of work experience in diverse capacities (e.g., HRM, B2C Sales). I have experienced organizations, management, and colleagues that allowed me to prosper and ones that beat me down. I am convinced of the value of the former, and therefore I study how we can create organizations with a focus on people.
