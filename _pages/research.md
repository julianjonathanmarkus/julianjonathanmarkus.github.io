Markus, J.J., Hewett, R., Leroy, H., Gangé, M., Van de Broeck, A.: “Negative Consequences of Worker Autonomy”.
Under review: International Journal of Management Reviews
  _Worker autonomy has benefits for individuals, organizations, and society. Yet, there is substantial empirical evidence that high autonomy may sometimes have negative consequences. We review this body of work to highlight five narratives for the negative consequences of autonomy: it can be a burden, it can allow unethical or immoral actions, it can require trade-offs, autonomy and control can be paradoxical, and autonomy is not universally experienced in the same way. We suggest that alternative lenses of autonomy – as independence or volition – change the mechanisms that explain these narratives. Together, this has implications for how we understand the outcomes related of worker autonomy. Our resulting theoretical model suggests that different strategies should be employed to enable autonomy to maximize the positive outcomes while mitigating the negative. We suggest that, because there is not a shared understanding of what we mean when we say autonomy, future research should make assumptions about what autonomy is and how it functions explicit.  _
  
Minnaar, J., Markus, J.J.; “Market, equality, community: A relational models view on self-managing organizations”
2nd R&R: Journal of Organization Design
 _ This paper explores how self-managing organizations (SMOs) organize without the traditional managerial hierarchy and how they consequently solve the universal problems of organizing: task division, task allocation, information provision, and reward provision. Drawing on Relational Models Theory (RMT), we conduct a multi-case study of exemplar SMOs spanning industries and geographies, identifying divergent relational logics, namely market pricing, equality matching, and communal sharing, which replace the managerial hierarchy (authority ranking). While all cases reject managerial hierarchy, each relies on a different relational logic and shows systematic variation in the identified solutions to the universal problems of organizing: radically decentralized structures and decentralized frameworks (task division), autonomous roles and self-distribution practices (task allocation), coordination mechanisms and decision-making protocols (information provision), and base salary structures and profit-sharing mechanisms (reward provision). These forms are not mutually exclusive but tend to stabilize around one dominant relational logic that serves as the organization’s backbone. This comparative analysis demonstrates that SMOs are not a single form of organizing but a family of forms that are designed and function in distinct ways. Through our rich, comparative, and empirically grounded analysis of exemplar SMOs, we advance understanding of how different relational logics provide alternative foundations for organizational designs in the absence of managerial hierarchy._

Lam. H. W., Ren. D., Darouei. M. Markus, J.J.: “Cold but Competent: The Paradoxical Effects of Solitude Expression on Social Evaluation at Work”.
Under review: Personnel Psychology
 _With recent changes in work forms, working alone remotely is increasingly common. Whereas a few may experience loneliness or difficulty in maintaining work-life balance, some employees may experience solitude, i.e., enjoying working alone. However, these solitude seekers may suffer from unintended interpersonal costs. Integrating signaling theory and the social evaluation literature, we hypothesized and tested the paradoxical effects of solitude expression with four pre-registered experiments. Specifically, we argue that individuals who express solitude would be judged as more competent, but less warm. The social evaluations would then mediate the relationship between solitude expression and work outcomes, including perceived productivity, leadership potential, and hireability of the target employee. In Study 1 and 2, we manipulated high and low solitude preferences with personality profiles among Dutch (N = 269) and British (N = 550) employees respectively. In Study 3 and 4, we explored the impact of target gender with two additional manipulations. In Study 3, we presented audio recordings as manipulations to a group of Dutch employees (N = 224). Finally in Study 4 that has a within-subject design, participants (N = 226) rated 12 profiles with different solitude preference and gender. Results generally supported our hypotheses that solitude-seeking employees would be rated as cold but competent, and hence, more productive and more hireable. We also found that gender stereotypes seemed less relevant in our research contexts, with solitude-preferring female targets considered to be better leaders than solitude-preferring male targets. We discuss theoretical and practical implications in connecting with the growing literatures on disconnected at work and work digitization. _
