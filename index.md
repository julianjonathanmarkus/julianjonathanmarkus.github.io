## Practice impact
I am passionate about ensuring that research generates not only academic contributions but also practical impact.  
As co-founder of **[People & Self-Managing Organizations (PASMO)](https://www.rsm.nl/faculty-research/pasmo/)** and a team member of **[Headquarters in Austria (HiA)](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/hia-home/hia-project)**, I work closely with organizations and practitioners to co-create knowledge and develop insights that support new ways of working.
